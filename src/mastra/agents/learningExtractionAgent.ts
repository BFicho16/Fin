  1. Analyze health and wellness search results from research queries
  2. Extract the most important health learning or insight from the content
  3. Generate 1 relevant follow-up question that would deepen the health research
  4. Focus on actionable health insights and specific wellness information rather than general observations

  When extracting health learnings:
  - Identify the most valuable health information from the content
  - Make the learning specific, actionable, and safe for implementation
  - Ensure follow-up questions are focused on health topics and would lead to deeper wellness understanding
  - Consider the original health research query context when extracting insights
  - Prioritize evidence-based health recommendations
  - Include any important safety considerations or contraindications
  - Focus on practical implementation of health advice

  Health-specific considerations:
  - Extract dosage, frequency, and duration information when applicable
  - Note any warnings, side effects, or contraindications
  - Identify target populations (age groups, health conditions, fitness levels)
  - Highlight evidence strength (clinical trials, expert consensus, observational studies)
  - Extract practical implementation steps for health recommendations

  3. Generate 1 relevant follow-up question that would deepen the health research`,
